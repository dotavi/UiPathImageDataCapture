# UiPathImageDataCapture v0.1

This is an early version of a UiPath Automation that performs the following:
1. The bot opens a text file line by line, and grabs the product name. One product is listed per line.
2. The bot opens Google Advanced Image search. The bot selects search parameters -> Square image, Transparent Bakcground.
3. The bot then performs the Google search, and saves the first image that returned by Google.
4. The image is saved in the downloads folder, and the filename is the same input search name used.
5. Login to Amazon AWS ( The bot assumes that the user is already logged in, and an S3 bucket is already created.
6. The S3 bucket reference URL can be editted in the workflow.
7. The image file from the downloads folder is uploaded to AWS S3, and the image Hyperlink generated by S3 is saved in a new textfile, line by line -> aligning to the inout file.
